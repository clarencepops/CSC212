
Secret Intelligence Service (known as "the Circus" because its London office is at Cambridge Circus), 
is living unhappily in forced retirement, following the failure of an operation codenamed Testify 
in Czechoslovakia which ended in the capture and torture of agent Jim Prideaux.  
Control, chief of the Circus, had suspected that one of the five senior intelligence officers at the 
Circus was a Soviet mole, and had assigned them code names for Prideaux to relay back to the Circus, 
derived from the English children's rhyme "Tinker, Tailor".   

Called out of retirement to settle the affairs of a friend, George Smiley finds his old organization, 
the Circus, so overwhelmed by political issues that it doesn't want to know what happened. 
He begins to follow up the clues of his friends past days, discovering that the clues 
lead to a high person in the Russian Secret Service, and a secret important enough to kill for. 

Smiley continues to put together the pieces a step ahead or a step behind the Russian killers.
